	<p><strong>Hello!</strong> I’m ryelle, aka Kelly, a senior frontend engineer with over a decade of experience building for the web. I started as a full-stack developer working with PHP and WordPress, but gravitated toward frontend development. Now I work mostly in JavaScript/React & CSS, with the occasional node.js CLI script. I’m a WordPress core committer, accessibility advocate, and sometimes conference speaker. I enjoy building tools that help people get things done.</p>
